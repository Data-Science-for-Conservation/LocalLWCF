# Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Analysis

This repository holds the data, processing code, and source files for an article on the LWCF. Visualizations analyze local grant amounts by US county and review the impact of LWCF grants in New England.

The article "A local look at the LWCF", including an interactive map with LWCF state grant dollars by US county, can be found [here](https://data-science-for-conservation.github.io/LocalLWCF/)

The steps to clean and combine datasets for the interactive map are found in the [LWCF grant value by county rollup Jupyter notebook](./Analysis/LWCF_Grant_Value_by_County_Rollup.ipynb).

Visualizations for the six New England states are found in the [New England funding analysis Jupyter notebook](./Analysis/LWCF_New_England_Funding_Analysis.ipynb).
